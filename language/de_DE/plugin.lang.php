- The RSS notification, accessible by all visitors (even if not registered) via "Notification"<br>
- Delivery by mail (NBM), accessible only by an administrator or webmaster that, can be likened to a newsletter
<br><br>
The idea of this plugin is to offer every <b><u>registered</u></b> visitor can subscribe or unsubscribe themselves from the NBM when he wants. To do this, simply activate the plugin (if you read this message, it means it\'s already done) to see a new option appear in the customize page of the visitor profile.
<br><br>
<b>Important</b>: If a visitor subscribes or unsubscribes from the NBM through it, no email confirmation will be sent from the gallery as is the case when an administrator does this through administration panel. This operation is intended to avoid negative behaviors of some visitors that would lead to a saturation of emails sending from the gallery.
<br><br>
PS: This plugin does not support the visitor information on the availability of this new option. You, Administrator / Webmaster, have to implement an information medium attached. For this, the plugin PWG_Stuffs is perfect ;-)';
