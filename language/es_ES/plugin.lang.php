- The RSS notification, usable by all visitors (even if not registered) in "Notification" menu<br>
- Notification by mail (NBM), usable only by an administrator or webmaster that is similar to a newsletter
<br><br>
The goal of this plugin is to offer to every <b><u>registered</u></b> visitor to subscribe or unsubscribe themselves from the NBM when he wants. To do this, simply activate the plugin (if you read this message, it means it\'s already done) to see a new option appear in the visitor\'s profile page.
<br><br>
<b>Important</b> : If a visitor subscribes or unsubscribes from the NBM through it, no email confirmation will be sent from the gallery as is the case when an administrator does this through administration panel. This operation is intended to avoid negative behaviors of some visitors that would lead to a saturation of emails sending from the gallery.
<br><br>
Note : This plugin does not support the visitor information on the availability of this new option. You, Administrator / Webmaster, have to implement an information medium attached. For this, the plugin PWG_Stuffs wil be perfect ;-)';
